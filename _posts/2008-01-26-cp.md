When you use the command line, and you know how to use it, you can be a lot more powerfull to make today’s task than with a common window manager. For example when you want to copy/paste a folder from one path to another, the command line goes really faster.

    $ cp myfolder /path/to/another

cp command is really simple to learn and to use, compare to rsync command, but rsync is a lot faster. So i want here to show you a tip to fake cp using rsync. You just have to make an alias. On my laptop i m using OpenSuse10.3, so i just edit the file ‘.alias’ in my home folder to put this in it:

    alias cp=”rsync -az”

Now i m continue to use cp, but faster than you ;)
