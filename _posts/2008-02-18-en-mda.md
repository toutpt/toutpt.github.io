Today I attended to a conference about Alfresco and MDA by BlueXML. What i have discovered is a set of softwares done with Eclipse and Acceleo to generate an Alfresco project (configure the portal, make content types, …). I have been really interested in the fact they have done a new meta model derivated from UML to model an ECM project and also a GUI modeler associated with this meta-model.

That means the meta-model can also be used for Plone3. For example configuring Plone, by creating group of user, permissions, workflows, … would be stuff available if we use it. But firstly i need to test it to validate the usability of this meta model and of the modeler. All is available at BlueXML home site.
