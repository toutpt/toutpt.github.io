I was looking for an easy way to get the current browser.contents in my real browser to easy debug what is happening in my doctest.

Here is the snippet:

Updated the 01/13/2009

```python
>>> import tempfile as tmp
>>> def contents():
...    fd, fn = tmp.mkstemp(suffix=".html", prefix="testbrowser-")
...    file = open(fn, 'w')
...    file.write(browser.contents)
...    file.close()
...    print fn
>>> import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

So now you can just call contents() and copy paste the file path in your real browser and see whatâ€™s happening in your tests. May it can be added to testbrowser.Browser ?
