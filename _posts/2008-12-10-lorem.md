Today i have made some fonctionnal tests with lorem ipsum text generator for Plone Selenium. The first thing i have done is to search for a python script to make text generation a la [lipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/).

I have been surprised by the fact most of scripts i have found use text alerady generated. It s the case for :

* [lorem-ipsum-generator](http://code.google.com/p/lorem-ipsum-generator/)
* [lorem](lorem)

But on the official web site we can find a python script : [pypsum](http://code.google.com/p/pypsum/). I have used and derived that one to generate CSV file by that way:

```sh
python data_csv.py -a 10 -f paras:3:texte_paras:1:description_words:5:title -d articles10_20081210_02.csv
```

And then:

```sh
python selenium_html.py -c articles10_20081210_02.csv -d articles10_20081210_02.html -o addArticles
```

For sure itâ€™s Plone specific code for the selenum part, but i m pretty happy of the result. I can now create random content for any website very quickly.
