Next to my first plone patch that improve performance I have profiling the code on a simple query: get a javascript from portal_javascript already computed.

The result is clear: 28% of the time is spent in opaqueitems. So I have discuss about it on [CMF mailing list](http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-cmf/2009-August/028559.html).

A monkey patch was already existing: [experimental.opaquespeedup](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/experimental.opaquespeedup). I have read the code. It replace the time consuming calls on all attributes by a catalog request. But I know that catalog can be slow if the web site has lots of contents. I have decided to make something more aggressive, by just removing opaqueitems that seems to be not used.

So use it at your own risk !
