I had the chance to work on a simple dataviz which is a gauge. I have make an effort to make it as easy to use as possible.



The first part was take a look at what already exists:

[react-svg-gauge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-svg-gauge) provide a good example but it is not responsive and do not provide the wanted gradient.
