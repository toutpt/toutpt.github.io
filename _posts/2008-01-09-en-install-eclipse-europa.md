Hi there, I have spent long time tring install my eclipse this week...  So I want to keep a log of this work. Here is it, a list of modules named with correct versions (that are working together).

* eclipse 3.3.1.1 (needeed for sure)
* acceleo-runtime-2.1.1
* mdt-uml2-SDK-2.1.1 (uml2 support)
* emf-sdo-xsd-SDK-2.3.1.zip (modeling framework)
* wtp-wst-M-2.0.2 (web source editors like xml, html, …)
* subclipse-1.2.4 (svn support)
* pydev-1_3_10 (python support)

I will now give you some links to install all that:

* eclipse
* acceleo
* mdt-uml2
* emf …
* wtp
* subclipse
* pydev

That's it. I need to add Mylyn support (mylyn + pydev support), and a UML2 modeler (like topcased) to be ready for MDA production ! But I have a pb with GMF on downloads. I hope it will be soon fixed.
